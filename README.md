# Tabletop Exercises

## About

This repository is dedicated to documenting and summarizing tabletop exercises involving various incident response scenarios tailored to matters related to information security. Each sub-repo is dedicated to a specific scenario facilitated by various vendors. The repo aims to enhance and practice theoretical knowledge to improve incident response readiness and resilience.

Each scenario outlined within a sub-repo will follow the provided exercise's activities and format, while providing room for personal thoughts and comments.

## What is a tabletop exercise?
A tabletop exercise is essentially a role-playing simulation where participants gather to discuss and practice their responses to a hypothetical scenario. During a tabletop exercise, a facilitator presents a scenario and guides the participants to discuss how they would react and what decisions must be made to complete the incident response process. Tabletop exercises can be played in multiple formats, ranging from a guided online video, virtual team meeting, to even in-person huddles around a table.



Some of the benefits of participating in a tabletop exercises are:

* Assessing, familiarizing, and improving one's incident response program
* Test communication, team coordination, and decision-making 
* Enhance collaboration among participants involved
* Evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and make any needed enhancements


Even as a solo-participant, there is a lot of value to be gained in engaging in tabletop exercises. As a solo-participant, you would still practice asking key critical questions covering the the Preparation/Detection & Analysis/Containment/Eradication/Recovery/Lessons Learned phases of the Incident Response Lifecycle. Additionally, you will get to observe the critical strengths and weaknesses of organizations and play along a simulation that will prepare you for engaging in a tabletop exercises with others in the future.
